# Gopher3D
An open-source 3D engine written in Go 
Note: This is a very early version, right now it's not more than a POC.

## How to run


---> DEPRECATING THE UI FOR NOW //go to ./cmd/ and run the gui_manager.go to interact via the precarious test interface 

Look at the examples folder to understand how to interact with the engine, it is very similar to other implementations, you only need to implement a Start, Update, and UpdateFixed function based on a predefined behavior.
