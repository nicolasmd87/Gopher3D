# Gopher3D
An open-source 3D engine written in Go 
Note: This is a very early version, right now it's not more than a POC.

## How to run

go to ./cmd/ and run the gui_manager.go to interact via the precarious test interface

Look at the examples folder to understand how to interact with the engine, it is very similar to other implementations, you only need to implement a Start and Update function based on a predefined behavior.
